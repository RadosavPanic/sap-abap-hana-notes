# What is SAP HANA

SAP HANA is an in-memory, column-oriented relational database management system designed to process massive amounts of real-time data with high performance.

The term HANA stands for *High-Performance Analytic Appliance*, and SAP HANA is not only a database but a complete platform that combines advanced hardware and software technologies.

Beyond core database services, SAP HANA provides built-in application services, data processing engines, development tools, and lifecycle management, enabling applications to run without a separate application server.

Most of the operations can be performed on a database level in SAP HANA, enabling less strain for server side of applications.

It supports advanced processing of various data types: text, spatial, graph, social, big data, and IoT data.

SAP HANA includes native integration and ETL capabilities for real-time, batch, and virtual data access from multiple source systems.
